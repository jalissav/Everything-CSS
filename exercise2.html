            <p class="wrapped-text">Billy the goat was the 
                sweetest of all goats, but also became a sad goat.
                Billy was taunted since he was a baby about his horns, 
                which weren't as sharp and witted as the rest of the goats. Because of this, Billy hated to leave his barn. The other goats made him regret it every time he tried. One day, something clicked within Billy. He realized that nothing in his animal world would stop the bullying, so he had to rise above instead. Billy is now a renowned motivational speaker and travels barn to barn to tell his story. It is Billy's mission to stop goat hate and donate to farms for less fortunate goats. </p>
